# ECS30-binary_matrix
C program that constructs a binary matrix based on dimensions entered by the user, updates the binary matrix based on a new input from the user, tests the dimensions of the binary matrix, and then deletes the binary matrix. binary_matrix.h is the header file, binary_matrix.c is the file with all the function implementations, binary_matrix_driver.c tests the functions within binary_matrix.c.

To test the code, use binary_matrix_driver.c to test it. First compile binary_matrix.c and binary_matrix_driver.c to produce object files by using gcc with the -c flag. Then compile the object files and create an executable.
